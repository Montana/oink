## Description
A bot for okcupid.com that replies to messages via scraping tweets. In this example, I used Donald Trump tweets. Written in Python and using Django.

## Requirements


```
Python
Django
Selenium
BeautifulSoup 
Requests
Django Admin Plus

```



## Usage

The first thing is to check your version of Django

``` python -m django --version ```

Assuming you have the latest version of Django installed, you can follow this

```
cd oink
chmod +x oink.py
python oink.py


```


You can then run the bot, the results are similar to this

## Comments

This is still a work in progress and the repository is not finished, but take a look at the code for now if you'd like. This is for EDUCATIONAL purposes only - do not use on OkCupid.
